        The infection it causes can lead to cervical, vulvar, and vaginal
        cancers in women, and penile cancer in men. It can also cause anal
        cancer, throat cancer, and genital warts. You can protect your child
        from ever developing these cancers with the HPV vaccine at ages 11–12.
        HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at
        least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Nearly 80 million
        Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV.
        <br />
        About 14 million Americans, including teens, become infected each year.

      <p><strong>Who should get the vaccine?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        The HPV vaccine is recommended for boys and girls at age 11 or 12 so
        they're protected before ever being exposed to the virus However, women
        younger than 26 and men who aren’t yet 21 can still get it. Men who are
        in sexual relationships with other men can get the vaccine until age 26.

      <p><strong>How do you get it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        The HPV vaccine comes in three doses. Your Pharmacist will give you the
        second shot a month or two after the first. You’ll get the third dose 6
        months after the opener.
        <br />
        Children who get the first dose before their 15th birthday only need two
        doses. Children who get the first dose on or after their 15th birthday
        need three doses.
