        Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza
        viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu
        infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as
        older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions,
        are at high risk of serious flu complications.<br />
        There are two main types of influenza (flu) virus:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Type A</li>
        <li>Type B</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people (human
        influenza viruses) are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year.
        The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year.

      <h5 class="text-black">Types of influenza</h5>
      <p>
        There are four types of flu viruses. Human influenza types A and B
        viruses are responsible for most seasonal flu viruses in the U.S., while
        influenza type C is believed only to cause mild illnesses and not
        outbreaks. Influenza type D mainly affects cattle and isn't known to
        cause infections in humans.<br />
        Each type of flu virus is further broken down into different strains,
        and strains can change over time.<br />
        Influenza A viruses are also found in many different animals, including
        birds and pigs. While it's unusual for people to get influenza
        infections directly from animals, sporadic human infections and
        outbreaks caused by certain avian influenza A viruses (or bird flu) and
        swine flu viruses, including H1N1 flu, have occurred.<br />

        One of the deadliest influenza outbreaks in history, the 1918 flu
        pandemic (known as the "Spanish flu") was believed to be caused by an
        H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin.

      <h5>How do you get the flu?</h5>
      <p>
        The flu is thought to be spread through tiny droplets that come out of
        an infected person's mouth during sneezing, coughing or talking. People
        nearby can inhale the infected droplets and become sick. You can also
        catch the flu if the infected droplets get on your hands and you touch
        your eyes, nose or mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Flu season occurs in fall and winter in the U.S., usually between
        October and May. While the flu virus is always going around, flu
        activity tends to increase between December and February.

      <h5>Flu vaccine</h5>
      <p>
        The CDC recommends that everyone ages six months and older receive a flu
        shot each year. Flu vaccination can prevent flu illnesses, health care
        provider visits and hospitalizations, and it can even be lifesaving in
        children. Getting a flu shot is a convenient way to help protect you and
        your family. <br />

        Your risk of having the flu is reduced by about half if you get the
        shot. However, if you still come down with it after you’ve been
        vaccinated, it’s likely to be shorter and less severe.

      <h5>FAQ</h5>
      <p><strong>Who needs it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Everyone -- young, old, and in between -- should get a flu shot, but
        especially pregnant women, people with long-term health issues, and
        people over 65 years old.

      <p><strong>Who shouldn't get it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        If you’ve had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction to the flu
        vaccine, or are allergic to eggs, or have had Guillain-Barre syndrome
        (which causes tingling, weakness, and loss of movement in your muscles),
        talk to your doctor about whether you should get it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="vm-section_content">
      <p><strong>When to get it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        It’s important to get a shot every year. Each will last just one flu
        season because the virus evolves. So, what worked this year may not work
        as well next year. <br />
        Typically, people come down with it between November and April, Anderson
        says. You should look for a new vaccine batch to hit your doctor’s
        office in late August or September.<br />
