      <p><strong>Who should get it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        If you were born after 1957, haven’t gotten your MMR vaccine, and have
        never had measles, you should see your doctor about getting the shot.
        It’s also good for:

        <li>College students</li>
        <li>Teachers</li>
        <li>Health care workers</li>

      <p class="mt-0">
        If you’re pregnant, have HIV or AIDS, are taking medication for cancer,
        or have a blood disorder, avoid it. Also, if you’ve had another vaccine
        within four weeks, recently had a blood transfusion, or are ill, you may
        need to delay your shot.
