        Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable liver infection caused by the
        hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or
        other body fluids from a person infected with the virus enters the body
        of someone who is not infected.<br />
        This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or
        other drug-injection equipment; or from mother to baby at birth.<br />
        Not all people newly infected with HBV have symptoms, but for those that
        do, symptoms can include fatigue, poor appetite, stomach pain, nausea,
        and jaundice. For many people, hepatitis B is a short-term illness.<br />
        For others, it can become a long-term, chronic infection that can lead
        to serious, even life-threatening health issues like cirrhosis or liver
        cancer.<br />
        Risk for chronic infection is related to age at infection: about 90% of
        infants with hepatitis B go on to develop chronic infection, whereas
        only 2%–6% of people who get hepatitis B as adults become chronically
        infected. The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get vaccinated.

      <p><strong> Can hepatitis B be prevented?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yes. The best way to prevent hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated. The
        hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. Completing the series of
        shots (2, 3, or 4 doses, depending on the manufacturer) is needed to be
        fully protected.

        <strong>Is the hepatitis B vaccine safe?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yes. The hepatitis B vaccine is safe, and soreness at the injection site
        is the most common side effect. As with any medicine, there are very
        small risks that a serious problem could occur after getting the
        vaccine. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more
        information, visit CDC’s vaccine safety site.

        <strong> What is a booster dose, and do I need one?</strong>

      <p class="mt-0">
        A “booster” dose is an extra dose of vaccine that can increase or extend
        the effectiveness of the vaccine. Most healthy people do not need a
        booster dose, but a blood test can be performed to check your immunity
        and decide if a booster dose of vaccine is necessary.
