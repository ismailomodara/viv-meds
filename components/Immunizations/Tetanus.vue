        Diphtheria and pertussis spread from person to person. Tetanus enters
        the body through cuts or wounds.<br />
        TETANUS (T) causes painful stiffening of the muscles. Tetanus can lead
        to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth,
        having trouble swallowing and breathing, or death.<br />
        DIPHTHERIA (D) can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure,
        paralysis, or death.<br />
        PERTUSSIS (aP), also known as “whooping cough,” can cause
        uncontrollable, violent coughing which makes it hard to breathe, eat, or
        drink.<br />
        Pertussis can be extremely serious in babies and young children, causing
        pneumonia, convulsions, brain damage, or death. In teens and adults, it
        can cause weight loss, loss of bladder control, passing out, and rib
        fractures from severe coughing. <br />

      <h5>FAQ</h5>
      <p><strong>Who should it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        It’s also a safeguard for those most vulnerable to the diseases, like
        people with compromised immune systems. If you’re pregnant, it’s
        especially critical to get the Tdap vaccine. It gives your baby
        short-term protection against whooping cough. <br />
        Tdap is only for children 7 years and older, adolescents, and adults.
        Adolescents should receive a single dose of Tdap, preferably at age 11
        or 12 years. Pregnant women should get a dose of Tdap during every
        pregnancy, to protect the newborn from pertussis.<br />
        Infants are most at risk for severe, life-threatening complications from
        pertussis. Adults who have never received Tdap should get a dose of
        Tdap. <br />
        Also, adults should receive a booster dose every 10 years, or earlier in
        the case of a severe and dirty wound or burn. Booster doses can be
        either Tdap or Td (a different vaccine that protects against tetanus and
        diphtheria but not pertussis). Tdap may be given at the same time as
        other vaccines.

      <p><strong>Who shouldn't get it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        If you’ve had seizures or an allergic reaction to Tdap, you may need to
        avoid it?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="vm-section_content">
      <p><strong>When to get it?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        If you’re pregnant, you should get the vaccine between your 27th and
        36th week. (Your baby will get his or her own vaccine, called DTaP, once
        he or she is born.) Everyone should have a booster for tetanus and
        diphtheria (called a Td) every 10 years, or any time you’re exposed to
        tetanus.
        <br />
        If you work with or are around infants, be sure to get your Tdap at
        least two weeks before coming into contact with them.
