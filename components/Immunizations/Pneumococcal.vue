        at greatest risk of serious illness and death. In the United States,
        there are 2 kinds of vaccines that help prevent pneumococcal disease
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or PCV13</li>

      <p class="mt-0">
        CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all children younger than 2

        children and other adults should also get pneumococcal vaccines. Below
        is more information about who should and should not get each type of
        pneumococcal vaccine.
        <br />

      <p><strong>Who Should Not Get These Vaccines?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Because of age or health conditions, some people should not get certain
        vaccines or should wait before getting them. Read the guidelines below
        specific to pneumococcal vaccines and ask your or your child’s doctor
        for more information.
        <br />
        Children younger than 2 years old should not get PPSV23. In addition,
        tell the person who is giving you or your child a pneumococcal conjugate
        vaccine if you or your child have had a life-threatening allergic
        reaction or have a severe allergy.
        <br />
        Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any of the
        following should not get PCV13:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A shot of this vaccine</li>
        <li>
          An earlier pneumococcal conjugate vaccine called PCV7 (or Prevnar®)
        </li>
        <li>Any vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid (for example, DTaP)</li>
        <li>
          Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to PPSV23
          should not get another shot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anyone with a severe allergy to any part of either of these vaccines
          should not get that vaccine.
        </li>
        <li>You or your child are not feeling well.</li>
        <li>
          People who have a mild illness, such as a cold, can probably get
          vaccinated. People who have a more serious illness should probably
          wait until they recover. Your or your child’s doctor can advise you.
