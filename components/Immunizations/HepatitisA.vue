        Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable liver infection caused by the
        hepatitis A virus (HAV). HAV is found in the stool and blood of people
        who are infected.<br />
        Hepatitis A is very contagious. It is spread when someone unknowingly
        ingests the virus — even in microscopic amounts — through close personal
        contact with an infected person or through eating contaminated food or
        drink. Symptoms of hepatitis A can last up to 2 months and include
        fatigue, nausea, stomach pain, and jaundice.<br />
        Most people with hepatitis A do not have long-lasting illness. The best
        way to prevent hepatitis A is to get vaccinated.

      <p><strong> Key Facts</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>About 24,900 new infections each year</li>
        <li>
          Effective vaccine available. Vaccination with the full, two-dose
          series of hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent infection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outbreaks still occur in the United States; currently there are
          widespread person-to-person outbreaks
        </li>
        <li>Recent foodborne outbreaks in US traced to imported food</li>
        <li>
          Common in many countries, especially those without modern sanitation

      <p><strong>Who should be vaccinated against hepatitis A?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that
        the following people be vaccinated against hepatitis A:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All children aged 12–23 months</li>
        <li>Unvaccinated children and adolescents aged 2–18 years</li>
        <li>People at increased risk for HAV infection</li>
        <li>International travelers</li>
        <li>Men who have sex with men</li>
        <li>
          People who use injection or non-injection drugs (all those who use
          illegal drugs)
        </li>
        <li>People with occupational risk for exposure</li>
        <li>
          People who anticipate close personal contact with an international
          adoptee
        </li>
        <li>People experiencing homelessness</li>
        <li>People at increased risk for severe disease from HAV infection</li>
        <li>People with chronic liver disease</li>
        <li>People with human immunodeficiency virus infection</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-0">Other people recommended for vaccination:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pregnant women at risk for HAV infection or severe outcome from HAV
          infection
        </li>
        <li>Any person who requests vaccination.</li>
        <li>
          Unvaccinated people in outbreak settings who are at risk for HAV
          infection or at risk for severe disease from HAV
        </li>

        <strong>How long does protection from hepatitis A vaccine last?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        The exact duration of protection against hepatitis A virus infection
        after vaccination is unknown.<br />
        Anti-HAV has been shown to persist for at least 20 years in most people
        receiving the 2-dose series as infants less than 2 years of age, those
        vaccinated with a 3-dose series as young children (aged 3–6 years) , and
        adults receiving the entire vaccine series during adulthood .

          >Can hepatitis A vaccine be administered concurrently with other
          vaccines?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yes. Hepatitis B, diphtheria, poliovirus (oral and inactivated),
        tetanus, typhoid (oral and intramuscular), cholera, Japanese
        encephalitis, rabies, and yellow fever vaccines can be given at the same
        time that hepatitis A vaccine is given.
        <br />
        In studies among young children, simultaneous administration of
        hepatitis A vaccine did not affect the immunogenicity or reactogenicity
        of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis; inactivated polio; measles,
        mumps, rubella (MMR); hepatitis B; and Haemophilus influenzae type b
        vaccines.

    <div class="vm-section_content">
      <p><strong>Can hepatitis A vaccine be given during pregnancy?</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yes. Pregnant women should be vaccinated for the same indications as
        non-pregnant women. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated pregnant
        adolescents should receive catch-up hepatitis A vaccination. See Adult
        Immunization Schedule by Medical and Other Indications.
        <br />
        Pregnant women at risk for hepatitis A during pregnancy should also be
        counseled concerning all options for preventing infection.

        <strong>
          Can hepatitis A vaccine be given to people who are immunocompromised
          (e.g., people on hemodialysis or people with HIV)?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yes. Because hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated, no special precautions
        need to be taken when vaccinating people who are immunocompromised.
        After completing the 2-dose vaccine series, most people who are
        immunocompromised do not need additional vaccines.
        <br />
        The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) now recommends
        that all people with HIV aged ≥1 year receive hepatitis A vaccine.
